                         HELPRADAR - PROJECT INFORMATION
                     For Presentation/PPT Creation Reference

================================================================================
                              PROJECT OVERVIEW
================================================================================

PROJECT NAME: HelpRadar
TAGLINE: Hyperlocal Community Help Platform
TYPE: Full-Stack Web Application
PURPOSE: A platform connecting communities for emergency help, lost items, 
         blood donation, and volunteer assistance.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
- Communities lack a centralized platform for local emergency help
- During emergencies, finding helpers in your area is difficult
- Blood donation requests often don't reach the right people in time
- Lost items rarely get reunited with owners due to limited reach

SOLUTION:
HelpRadar provides a hyperlocal platform where:
- Users can post help requests visible to their local community
- Urgent requests are prioritized and highlighted
- Location-based filtering helps find nearby people
- Real-time notifications ensure timely responses

                              VIVA TALKING POINTS
================================================================================

Q: Why MongoDB?
A: Posts are independent documents with variable fields (images, coordinates). 
   MongoDB's flexible schema and native geo-queries make it ideal. Also supports
   TTL indexes for auto-expiry.

Q: Why Next.js?
A: Combines React UI with API routes in one framework. Fast SSR, great developer
   experience, easy Vercel deployment. App Router provides modern React patterns.

Q: How does authentication work?
A: NextAuth.js v5 handles both OAuth (Google) and credentials. JWT-based sessions
   stored in HTTP-only cookies. Password hashed with bcryptjs.

Q: How is data privacy handled?
A: Contact details masked by default. Helper messaging goes through our system.
   Passwords hashed. OTPs expire in 10 minutes.

Q: What makes the priority engine "smart"?
A: Keyword analysis on title and description. Matches against predefined
   dictionaries for categories and urgency. No ML needed - rule-based and fast.

Q: How does the notification system work?
A: Dual system - in-app (bell icon) and email. Stored in MongoDB with TTL.
   Context provider for real-time updates. Mark read individually or all at once.

Q: How would you scale this?
A: MongoDB Atlas sharding for high load. Redis for caching frequent queries.
   CDN for static assets. Vercel edge functions for API routes.
